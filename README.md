# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
* It is the first dataset on which the every data scientist and practicionere works on it.
* It is one of the most important 

## Getting Started
* First Download the Dataset from the link given in the Data Sources field as the dataset was quite large.
* Clone the repo 
* Go to the File and run the .py file through cmd with python3 as the default python version/virtual environment could also be used in it.

## How Things Are Working
* As a newbie I had basically worked upon the basics of the how we can use the Machine Learning for finding the life and death preidiction according to the dataset. 
### Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python3
* Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and other Libraries
* Visualization:Plotly and Numpy

### Data Sources:
Datasets used for the analysis can be found on the given [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data):smiley:.
### Prerequisites
Pre install all the dependencies before cloning the repo
```
pip install python3 seaborn matplotlib numpy plotly
```
You should already need to have all the dependencies installed already.:boom:

## Built With 

* [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Best Editor for the Code Writing and Debugging
* [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) - All the dependecy are used on Python3
* [Kaggle Machine Learning From Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) -Get the Dataset from here.
